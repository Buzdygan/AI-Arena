Ships Game

You probably know the traditional ships game, played on paper.
This one is the same, but played by computers.

At the beggining of each round, the board size and ships
types are being picked randomly, then sent to the players.
Afterwards players send decisions where to place their ships.
Ships should not be placed on the adjacent fields.
Finally players shoot at chosen fields to destroy opponent's
ships. The one who shoots the last opponent's ship is the winner.


Protocol:
Game consists of 50 rounds. The bot knows that the round has come to an end,
if it received negative number.
-1 means it won the round
-2 means it lost the round
-3 means draw (too many rounds played) 

At beggining of the round, player receives
integer n signifying the size of board (n x n).
Then there is integer m. m is the number of ships to place.
Afterwards player reads m integers which are the types of
ships given for this round (both players have the same types).
After reading types of ships, player sends decision about his ship placement.

The decision consists of 3m integers.
For each ship player sends 3 integers: ship_type, positionx, positiony,
ship_type - type of ship placed
positionx, positiony - coordinates of the rightmost field taken by the ship.
If there are many y coordinates with largest x, choose the lowest one.

Next player sends two integers: x,y which are the coordinates of a shot.
Then, player receives two integers shot_result, dead.
shot_result - 0 if it was a miss, or type of ship shot.
dead - 1 if the shot ship was destroyed, 0 otherwise.
Shooting is prosecuted until the end of the round.

Ship types:
