Paper soccer

Paper soccer (or as some call it paper hockey) is a popular game for which you
need only a pice of paper and a pen. Or, in this case, a PC and a good AI :)

The board is a 9x11 rectangle of dots, with extra rows of 3 dots in the middle
on both ends, which are considered goals. Also, beetween the dots on the
boundary, the filed lines are draw.

The star is the middle of the field and indicates the starting position of the
ball. 

The players move in turns. When his turn comes, the player can move the ball
to one of the eight adjecent dots, and draw a line beetwen the old and new positions
of the ball.

Example of a first move:

You can cross the line that was drawn before, but you can't move on top of it.

The extra rule is : if after your move the ball has landed on a line (doesn't
matter if it's a field line or a line drawn by moving the ball), you have to
make an extra move.

Also, if you can't make a move, (because all the routes are blocked) you lose.
The classic example of this is going into a corner - by doing this you
automatically block the only way out of the corner.

Then the other player makes his move. The game ends when the ball reaches one
of the goals (the top or bottom row with only three dots) or one of the
players gets blocked.

Here is an example of few first moves of a possible game:

In the last move, the player "bounced off the line".

You can read an alternatve game description, and even play the game against
human opponents in real time on sites:

www.playok.en/soccer
www.kurnik.pl/pilka

During a faceoff between two bots, foru matches total will be played (each bot
will have the first move twice). Each bot will get the number of points equal
to number of matches it won.

Encoding of directions:

7   0   1
  \ | /
6 - * - 2
  / | \
5   4   3

A move can be considered a sequence of directions, of length at least 0.

The communication protocol for the bots is the following:

If the bot receives the communicate "INIT\n", it signals the start of a new
match. The bot should send back a communicate "OK\n" and prepare itself.

Right after the "INIT\n" communicate a direction communicate will be sent. It
will be either "UP\n" or "DONW\n". If you receive an "UP\n" communicate, it
means the goal you are shooting at is in the "0" direction. Conversly, if you
receive the "DOWN\n" communicate, you should be shooting at the goal in the
"4" direction.
The bot should respond with another "OK\n" communicate.



Now the fun part. The judge will prompt the bot with communicate "MOVE
[LIST]\n" where LIST is a list of moves that was performed by the opponent in
his last turn. If the list is empty, it means there was no previous move, and
the bot is prompted for a first move in the match.
The bot should reply with a list of directions in which he kicks the ball.

Example of a communication from the example drawing:

Player1:
Recv  : "INIT\n"
Send  : "OK\n"

Player2:
Recv  : "INIT\n"
Send  : "OK\n"

Player1:
Recv  : "UP\n"
Send  : "OK\n"

Player2:
Recv  : "DOWN\n"
Send  : "OK\n"

Player1:
Recv  : "MOVE []\n"
Send  : "[1]\n"

Player2:
Recv  : "MOVE [1]\n"
Send  : "[4]\n"

Player1:
Recv  : "MOVE [4]\n"
Send  : "[6,7]\n"

Player2:
Recv  : "MOVE [6,7]\n"
